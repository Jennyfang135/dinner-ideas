## Description
My project is 'What's for dinner?', as this is the question I am always asked by my children, it would be a good idea if I can have a menu app that stores all my favourite meuns. Basic function

1. As a user, I want to see all the available food category
2. As a user, I can click on one of the food category and see more options
3. As a user, I can see a list of the menu options under the food category that is clicked
4. As a user, I can click on perticular menu that I am interested
5. As a user, I can see the menu details on the menu that I clicked.

## Stretch
1. As a user, I can write comments on it.
2. As a user, I can find some food nutrition information - ability of connecting ot public API
